            <p><strong>Bhagat Singh</strong> was one of India's greatest freedom fighters, known for his courage, patriotism, and revolutionary ideas. He played a significant role in India's struggle for independence from British rule. 
                Born on September 28, 1907, in Banga, Punjab, Bhagat Singh grew up in a politically charged environment. Inspired by the sacrifices of previous freedom fighters, he joined the struggle against colonial rule at a young age. His deep understanding of revolutionary ideologies led him to become a prominent member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA). 
                He strongly believed that independence could only be achieved through radical change and was deeply influenced by socialist and Marxist principles. His famous slogan, "Inquilab Zindabad" (Long Live the Revolution), continues to echo in the hearts of patriots to this day.</p>
